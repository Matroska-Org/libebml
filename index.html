<p>EBML was designed to be a simplified binary extension of XML for the purpose of storing and manipulating data in a hierarchical form with variable field lengths.</p>

<p>It uses the same paradigms as XML files, meaning that syntax and semantics are separated. So a generic EBML library could read any format based on it. The interpretation of data is up to a specific application that knows how each elements (equivalent of XML tag) has to be handled.</p>

<p>Among all the advantages of XML, there are a few limitations compared to what XML can achieve:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is currently no equivalent to a DTD or Schema to define known elements for a document. But we plan on adding such a level.</li>
<li>No entity can be defined, ie an element that would be replaced by another content. We don't plan to add something like this so far.</li>
<li>No external include of other files (like CSS, images, etc). It could be easily added as a "proprietary" element (not defined in the basic EBML format).</li>
</ul>

<p>For the rest, you have all advantages like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upward compatibility when the format is updated. Something rare in binary formats, unless you have some unused space in the original format.</li>
<li>Unlimited size of binary data.</li>
<li>Very size efficient: only space required for a data is written (unless you specifically require more space for better updating later).</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also one disadvantage commonly said about XML: it's very verbose. That's why you should have default/assumed values in you EBML-based format as much as possible. So you just describe what is really necessary.</p>

<p>EBML was originally created for the <a href="http://www.matroska.org">Matroska</a> project. So this is naturally the first format based on EBML to exist. You are therefore encouraged to check the specs to know how to design a format based on EBML.</p>
